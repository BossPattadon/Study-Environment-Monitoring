# Study Environment Monitoring

A full-stack application that monitors physical study conditions in real time — temperature, humidity, light, noise, and air quality — and computes a **study-suitability index** by integrating IoT sensor data with third-party weather and air-quality APIs.

## Project Overview

This system continuously collects environmental data from physical IoT sensors installed in a study room (temperature, humidity, light, noise) and enriches it with outdoor air-quality readings from public APIs (IQAir, OpenAQ, OpenWeatherMap). A scoring algorithm converts raw sensor values into a **study-suitability index** (0–100) that tells you at a glance how conducive your current environment is for focused study.

### Features

- **Live dashboard** — real-time study index ring with per-metric sub-scores
- **Air quality page** — current US AQI, PM2.5, outdoor temperature/humidity with time-series charts
- **History page** — interactive historical charts and raw data table with configurable date range
- **Forecast page** — ML-based predictions of the study index and PM2.5 for the next N hours, with four swappable models (MLP, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- **Insights page** — rule-based recommendations based on current readings
- **Settings page** — configurable scoring weights persisted on the backend
- **Swagger UI** — interactive API documentation at `/api-docs`

## Data Sources

### Primary — IoT Sensors

Physical sensors connected to a microcontroller (Arduino / ESP) post readings to `POST /api/sensors`:

| Sensor | Measures |
|---|---|
| DHT11 | Temperature (°C), Humidity (%RH) |
| KY-018 photoresistor | Light level (lux) |
| Sound sensor | Noise level (ADC 0–1023) |
| PIR | Motion detection |

### Secondary — Web APIs

Polled externally and stored in the database:

| Source | Data |
|---|---|
| [IQAir](https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-api) | US AQI, main pollutant |
| [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org) | PM2.5 (µg/m³) |
| [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) | Outdoor temperature, humidity, weather description |

## Study-Suitability Index

Every time a sensor reading arrives, the backend computes a **study index** entry by combining all available data into five sub-scores, then applying a weighted average:

| Sub-score | Ideal range | Scoring method |
|---|---|---|
| Light | 300–500 lux | Linear ramp below 300; gentle penalty above 500 |
| Noise | ADC ≤ 620 (quiet) | Linear 100→0 between ADC 620–800 |
| Temperature | 23–26 °C | Symmetric decay from midpoint (−5 pts/°C outside band) |
| Humidity | 40–60 %RH | Symmetric decay from midpoint (−5 pts/%RH outside band) |
| AQI | ≤ 50 | US EPA piecewise: 100→75→50→25→0 across breakpoints 50/100/150/200/300 |

The **total score** (0–100) is a weighted average of the five sub-scores:

```
total = (light × w_light + noise × w_noise + temp × w_temp
         + humidity × w_humidity + aqi × w_air) / sum(weights)
```

Weights are configurable from the Settings page and persisted on the backend via `PUT /api/settings/weights`.

| Status | Score range |
|---|---|
| Good | ≥ 80 |
| Moderate | 50–79 |
| Poor | < 50 |

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. Full interactive documentation is available at **`/api-docs`** (Swagger UI) once the backend is running.

| `POST` | `/api/sensors` | Submit a new sensor reading (triggers scoring) |

## GitHub Repository

**[https://github.com/BossPattadon/Study-Environment-Monitoring](https://github.com/BossPattadon/Study-Environment-Monitoring)**

### Building and Running

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BossPattadon/Study-Environment-Monitoring.git
cd Study-Environment-Monitoring
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Installs both backend and frontend from the repo root
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Configure environment variables

**Backend** — create `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=8000

DB_HOST=your-mysql-host
DB_USER=your-db-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_NAME=your-db-name
```

> The remote MySQL server enforces `max_user_connections = 5`. The pool's `connectionLimit` is set to `3` in `config/db.js` — do not raise it above `4`.

**Frontend** — create `frontend/.env`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### 4. Run the application

Open two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend (port 8000)
cd backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 3000)
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API documentation (Swagger UI): http://localhost:8000/api-docs

---

## Common Issues

### `Can't add new command when connection is in closed state`
The MySQL connection timed out. Resolved — the backend uses a connection pool (`mysql.createPool`) which acquires fresh connections automatically.

### `ER_USER_LIMIT_REACHED`
`connectionLimit` in `config/db.js` is too high. Keep it at `3` or lower.
